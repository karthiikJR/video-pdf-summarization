This is a very short film. It does not advance our plot at all. The narrator explains how he plans to teach a course called "java streams api" on his website. The goal of the course is to make people write real code, not boilerplate. It covers everything from idea to implementation in about two weeks. The instructor uses intelliJCI as his example. He encourages people to use any IDE they like as their starting point for learning about this new kind of programming. For those of you who want to try out some of the ideas presented in the course, there are many different editions available. The most important thing that the narrator wants people to learn, however, is to be able to understand transformations and map making sense of data. This course will cover all aspects of functional programming in java.
